## My process

-Started with mobile design first than use media queries for desktop layout. I used flexbox for the desktop layout so the card are aligned in a row as well as centering
the container vertically and horizontally 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I learned that flexbox is not always needed when designing mobile layout.


### Continued development

My next projects will be building a full responsive website so i can continue to refine my flexbox knowledge, also learn how to do a hamburger menu since i haven't done it yet

### Useful resources

- Stack overflow
- MDN web docs
- Youtube
